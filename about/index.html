 <p> When I was little, my parents introduced the “No singing at the dinner table rule,” because of me. I have been communicating my whole life. I love to travel, write, try new foods, learn other languages, and share my experiences with others. I am a student currently enrolled in the Professional Writing Program at Michigan State University. I have experience in technical writing, social media, editing and design. I am also fluent in French and love to travel.

	I work for MSU Extension as the assistant to the associate director and the assistant to the director of stakeholder relations for the MSU College of Agriculture and Natural Resources. I also work on special projects for the MSU Extension Communications team such as press releases. I also manage the MSU Extension Spotlight, which is the Director's blog.
